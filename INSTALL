Installation instructions for debian based systems such as Ubuntu or Debian:

* build the .deb package (only needed if you don't have a ready made package)

  sudo apt-get install po-debconf debhelper dbconfig-common sun-java6-jdk mysql-client libmysql-java scala scala-library

  debuild -us -uc

As an alternative to debuild you can run

  git-buildpackage -us -uc

if you cloned the git repository (debuild will work also, but git-buildpackage
does some extra sanity checks). In the end you will have a file called
etherpad*.deb in the directory one level above your current directory.

* install the .deb package

  cd ..
  sudo dpkg -i etherpad*.deb


Installation instructions for POSIX compatible unix systems (also works for Debian and Ubuntu):

* Install the dependencies: Scala 2.7, Sun Java JDK 6, libmysql-java

* Uninstall gcj if it's installed as it seems to interfere with the
  Scala compiler. You can safely reinstall it after compiling Etherpad
  if you want to.

* Edit the file bin/exports.sh (and optionally
  etherpad/bin/etherpad.default) and change the paths to match your
  system.

* Run bin/build.sh

* Create a new user on your system called "etherpad"

* Create a MySQL database "etherpad" and a database user "etherpad"

* Copy etherpad/etc/etherpad.localdev-default.properties to etherpad/etc/etherpad.local.properties

* Edit etherpad/etc/etherpad.local.properties and set
   etherpad.SQL_JDBC_URL
       Example etherpad.SQL_JDBC_URL = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/etherpad
   etherpad.SQL_PASSWORD
   etherpad.SQL_USERNAME = etherpad
   etherpad.adminPass
   topdomains
       Example: topdomains = yourhostname.com,localhost

* Create a link to bin/etherpad.init.d from /etc/init.d/etherpad

* Run /etc/init.d/etherpad start
